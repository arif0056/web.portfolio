                <p>The most important skill or knowledge every developer should learn first is these three basic building blocks i.e. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You will be using HTML and CSS in frontend for interfaces. Just right click on your web browser and then select view page source option. You will find the structure of your website where a lot of HTML tags are used for different purposes. CSS is also used in the frontend that decides the style, design, layout and how HTML elements need to be displayed on the screen.</p>
